# jCells

Oh, right. The README.

This is Rube (https://github.com/kennytilton/rube/wiki) for Javascript. Rube was Cells for Clojure*.

So far I have pure Cells mostly ported (not all tests have been ported). Next up is DEFMODEL.

I am looking at a fuller treatment of models than in Rube since Javascript has better support for objects than does Clojure. (You can define getters and setters and a constructor, things that matter for transparency -- and we like transparency.)

Then I will turn it into a web application framework involving nothing but HTML and CSS. And jCells, but that is no harder to learn than VisiCalc. Look it up.

I have done this before in MCL, Windows GDK, Tcl/Tk, OpenGL, qooxdoo and qooxdoo mobile so it should go well, especially since the HTML and CSS will be your problem. I mean that in a good way.
