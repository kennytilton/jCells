# jCells

This is Clj/CLJS [Rube](https://github.com/kennytilton/rube/wiki) for Javascript. Rube was Common Lisp [Cells](https://github.com/kennytilton/cells/wiki) for Clojure.

So far I have pure Cells ported and DEFMODEL far enough along that I have turned to [ciWeb](https://github.com/kennytilton/ciWeb).

Thems links have more info.

Happy (data)flowing.
